## Lesson 6

## Dealing with Numbers
We use the term *data type* to explain tha nature of the data that a variable contains. A string variable contains a character string, a number variable contains a numerical value, and so forth. However, the Javascript language is loosley typed, meaning that the variables can be interpreted as different data types in differing circumstances.

## Numbers
There are many different types of numbers, *natural numbers* (1,2,3,4..), *whole numbers* (simply add 0) and *negative numbers* which form the set of *integers*.
