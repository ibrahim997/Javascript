## Interacting with the User
Among the methods belonging to the *window* object, some are designed specifically to help your page communincate with the user by assisting with the input and output of information.

## *alert()*
You'll recall the *alert()* method would pop up an information dialog for the user. This modal dialog simply shows your message with a single OK button.
