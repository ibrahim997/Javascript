# Lesson 1

## Introduction

Hypertext Markup Language is not a programming language but a markup language.
You can use it to mark parts of your page to indicate to the browser that these
parts should be shown in a particular way - using bold or italic text, for instancec, or
as a heading, alist of bullet points, a table of data, or using manyn other markup options.

Once these pages are written they are static by nature. They can't respond to user actions,
make decisions, or modify the display of their page elements. The markup they contain will always
be interpreted and dislpayed in the same way whenever a user vists the page.

The World Wide Web contains modern websites that much more and routinely visit are often
far more than static. They can contain "live" data, such as share prices or flight arrival times,
animated displays with changing colors and fonts, or interactive capabilities such as the ability
to click through a gallery of photographs or sort a column of data.

These capabilities are provided to the user through programs, often known as scripts 
that operate behind the scenes to manipulate what is being displayed on the browser.

## Server vs. Client-side Programming

There are two fundamental ways of adding scripts to otherwise a static web content:
> A web server executes a script before delivering the page to the user. Such script may define what 
  information is sent to the browser for display to the user - for example, by retrieving product prices
  from the database of an online store, checking a user's identity cedentials before loggin her in to a private
  area fo the website, or retrieving the contents of an email mailbox.
  These scripts are generally run at the web sever before generating the requested web page and serving
  it to the user. This particular way of adding script is known as *server-side* scripting.
